## Module 15 Challenge  

The purpose of this challenge (per BCS) is to develop "a way to visualize USGS data that will allow them to better educate the public and other government organizations (and hopefully secure more funding) on issues facing our planet."

The requirements are to create a map (60 points) and add markers (40 points) per the instructions.  

## Process and Resources
### Timeline/Insights:  
0817  Created repository, cloned locally, added and commited starter files, formatted README.md  
  
0818  Using Day 1: 10-Stu_GeoJson was able to load in the data, the tile layer, and bind the popups. Was not successful in changing the markers and need to review before completing.  
  
0821  Reviewed class recordings and took refreshed approach to build code. May not work with GeoJSON so will come back to it.
  

### Links used:
Used examples from Module 15 class activities.
* 0818  Specifically used Day 1: 10-Stu_GeoJson as a starting point.
